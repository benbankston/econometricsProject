I used Stata to analyze the effect of beer taxes on alcohol-related traffic fatalities in the United States. We collected alcohol-related fatality data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and data on beer taxes from the Tax Foundation. 
Our regression analysis showed a decrease in alcohol-related traffic fatalities with an increase in beer taxes.
